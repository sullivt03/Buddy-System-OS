# Buddy-System-OS
This code is used to create a buddy memory management system. The system divides a memory block size by two until it is the smallest possible power of 2 that will fit an object. For example, if something of size 7 is going to be stored, it will find a block size, if available, of size 8, 2^3, to store it in. The code works in the same way, getting the size of the desired object to be inserted, finding a possible block for it, and inserting it into that block. If an item is removed, it marks the block as "empty" and can merge with other blocks around it in order to create a larger space to store something in if need be.
